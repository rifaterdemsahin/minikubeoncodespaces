| Service Type  | Usage Scenario                                                                                  | Accessibility                                 | IP Address Scope                             |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **NodePort**  | - Exposes the service on a static port on each node’s IP.                                        | - External traffic can access using node IPs. | - IP of any node in the cluster.            |
|               | - Typically used for testing or limited external access.                                         |                                               | - Fixed port range (30000-32767).           |
| **ClusterIP** | - The default type, only accessible within the cluster.                                          | - Internal cluster communication only.        | - Internal cluster IP.                      |
|               | - Useful for internal services that don’t need external exposure (e.g., microservices).          |                                               | - No external access directly.              |
| **LoadBalancer**| - Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.                       | - External traffic gets routed through a load balancer. | - External IP from cloud provider.     |
|               | - Best used in cloud environments where a load balancer service is available.                    |                                               | - Direct access to service via load balancer.|
```

### Quick Summary:
- **NodePort**: Use when you want to expose a service externally without relying on a cloud provider.
- **ClusterIP**: Use for internal services that only need to communicate within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **LoadBalancer**: Use when running in a cloud environment and want to expose the service externally with automatic load balancing.
