| Service Type  | Usage Scenario                                                                                  | Accessibility                                 | IP Address Scope                             |

| **NodePort**  | - Exposes the service on a static port on each node’s IP.                                        | - External traffic can access using node IPs. | - IP of any node in the cluster.            |
|               | - Typically used for testing or limited external access.                                         |                                               | - Fixed port range (30000-32767).           |
| **ClusterIP** | - The default type, only accessible within the cluster.                                          | - Internal cluster communication only.        | - Internal cluster IP.                      |
|               | - Useful for internal services that don’t need external exposure (e.g., microservices).          |                                               | - No external access directly.              |
| **LoadBalancer**| - Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.                       | - External traffic gets routed through a load balancer. | - External IP from cloud provider.     |
|               | - Best used in cloud environments where a load balancer service is available.                    |                                               | - Direct access to service via load balancer.|
```

### Quick Summary:
- **NodePort**: Use when you want to expose a service externally without relying on a cloud provider.
- **ClusterIP**: Use for internal services that only need to communicate within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **LoadBalancer**: Use when running in a cloud environment and want to expose the service externally with automatic load balancing.

Let me know if you need further details on any of these.

Here's a breakdown of sample implementations using **Nginx** with each of the service types: **NodePort**, **ClusterIP**, and **LoadBalancer** in Kubernetes.

### 1. **NodePort**
In this scenario, Nginx will be exposed on a fixed port within the range `30000-32767`, making it accessible externally through the IP address of any node in the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80               # The port your service will listen on inside the cluster
      targetPort: 80          # The container port where Nginx is running
      nodePort: 30007         # Optional: Specify a fixed node port in the 30000-32767 range
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Accessing**:
You can access the Nginx service externally by going to:  
`http://<Node_IP>:30007`

### 2. **ClusterIP**
This is the default service type in Kubernetes and will be used only for internal communication within the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-clusterip
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Accessing**:
You will only be able to access the Nginx service from within the Kubernetes cluster using the service name, like:  
`http://nginx-clusterip:80`


### 3. **LoadBalancer**
This is ideal for cloud environments. It automatically provisions a cloud load balancer that routes traffic to your Nginx service.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Accessing**:
Once the service is created, the cloud provider will assign an external IP to access the service. For example:  
`http://<External_LoadBalancer_IP>:80`

### Summary of Use Cases:
- **NodePort**: Great for exposing the service in environments without cloud infrastructure.
- **ClusterIP**: Ideal for internal microservices communication.
- **LoadBalancer**: Preferred for cloud environments with automatic load balancer provisioning.
