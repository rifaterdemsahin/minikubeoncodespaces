To see the public DNS for your NGINX service via the Ingress, you can run the following command:

```bash
kubectl get ingress
```

The output will look something like this:

```bash
NAME            CLASS    HOSTS          ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
nginx-ingress   <none>   nginx.local    <public-ip>     80      10m
```

In the `HOSTS` column, you'll see the domain (`nginx.local` in this case), and in the `ADDRESS` column, you will see the public IP address or DNS that Minikube is exposing. If you're running this in Codespaces and have set up port forwarding, the `HOSTS` column might show a generated URL from Codespaces.

To see the exact DNS in Codespaces:

1. Go to the **Ports** tab in your Codespaces interface.
2. Find the entry for port 80 (or the port youâ€™ve exposed), and Codespaces will generate a public URL.
   
That URL is the public DNS you can use to access your NGINX service.

Let me know if you need more help with the process!
