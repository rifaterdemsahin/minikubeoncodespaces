It looks like you're trying to install `ping` and `net-tools` packages in your GitHub Codespaces environment but encountered issues. Here's how you can fix it:

sudo apt update

### 1. `ping` not available:
The error you're seeing is because `ping` is part of the **`iputils-ping`** package, not a separate `ping` package.

To install `ping`, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install iputils-ping
```

### 2. `net-tools` already installed:
Youâ€™ve already installed `net-tools`, which includes essential networking utilities like `ifconfig`, `netstat`, and `route`. You don't need to reinstall it.

Once `iputils-ping` is installed, you should be able to use `ping` for network diagnostics.

Let me know if you run into any other issues! ðŸ˜Š
